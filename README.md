### Description

This is a basic layout for a shell that looks like Linux RedHat. Comes with a few custom controls for easy customization. Has a 'startmenu', 'taskbar' as well has desktop icons. i was really bored and this is what i came up with. i didnt mean for this to have any use, just did it for fun.
